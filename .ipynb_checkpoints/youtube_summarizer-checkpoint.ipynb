      "The video discusses the historical connections between the Bini (Edo) people from the Benin Kingdom and Lagos State, sparked by a claim made by the Oba of Benin in 2023 that the Edo people founded Lagos. This incited debate as it contradicts well-documented history and archaeological evidence. The first settlers of what is now Lagos were the Awori people, a subgroup of the Yoruba ethnic group, who settled in the region around 6000 BC. The Awori people occupied various locations, including Ota and Iseri, as well as the area now known as Ibutemeta along the lagoon. The video clarifies that the Edo and Yoruba are distinct ethnic groups, with no historical subordination of the Edo people under the Yoruba. Additionally, the video emphasizes the geographical separation between Edo territories and those of the Awori, underscoring the cultural and historical distinctions between these groups.\n"

It provides a nuanced discussion by dissecting the linguistic and cultural differences between the Edo and Yoruba people, underscoring that the Edo are a distinct ethnic group from the Yoruba. The presenter reviews archaeological and historical evidence, showcasing that the Awori people, a Yoruba subgroup, were the initial settlers in the Lagos region as far back as 6,000 BC. Geographical descriptions are provided to demonstrate the settlements of the Awori people, including various islands and coastal regions.
